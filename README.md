# Semester III Web Programming Lab mini project 1 and 2
The layout and design was made by my partner, and the coding and other changes were done by me. 
A very basic project to demonstrate skills in HTML and CSS

The project is upgraded using javascript to add a search bar functionality as well as a form validation set up for the review page. This is to show skills in JS, for the second part of the project.
